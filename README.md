# Optimization-Methods

> Solve optimization problems showing every calculating step so that you will not be bothered by your operational research homeworks.

Currently, I have included functions that help you plot the feasible regions for 2d problems, functions for bound tightening, prime and dual simplex algorithm, cutting plane algorithm and branch and bound algorithm in the Linear and Integer Programming notebook. The project is still ongoing and there are more to be expected!
